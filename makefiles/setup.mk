# Path and tool setup

#
# Some useful paths.
#
# Note that in general we always keep directory paths with the separator
# at the end, and join paths without explicit separators. This reduces 
# the number of duplicate slashes we have lying around in paths,
# and is consistent with joining the results of $(dir) and $(notdir).
